---->My notes are marked by these arrows for each of the requirements

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements 
---->Was not sure about changing the "header" to "nav" and kept "content"; replaced with "articles" and "aside"
---->replaced "content" with "section" and "header" with "nav"


WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
---->Yes in the index file, not sure how nit picky to be in the css file in terms of ordering.

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
---->Very confident about this part. Even figured out how to title the div of the background image, the hero div.

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
---->Yes, I think I got this part. Corrected the reset.css

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
---->Yes, done.
